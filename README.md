# My dotfiles

I'm a lazy person: that's why I wrote this script.
I just want to setup my Linux shell with my configuration, and that's what this script simply does.

## What does this script do?

A few things:
 - VIM
   - use a color scheme for dark background
   - enable syntax color
   - use 4 spaces for tabs
 - Git
   - enable color
 - Bash aliases
   - list files with 'll' with colors
   - enable fancy formatting

## How do I run this script?

Just run this command line:

```{r, engine='bash'}
$ curl -sSL http://bit.ly/2EWtw2p | sh 
```
